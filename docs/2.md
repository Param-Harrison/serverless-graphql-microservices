title: 🔎 The GraphQL API
---

# 🔎 GraphQL

Let's first give a little intro to GraphQL and the different parts it consist of. 

## Concepts

- **Schema**, this is where you define your data types and what things you can query for
- **Resolvers**, these are functions that are being invoked when you ask for something from the schema. Your resolvers should respond with data or change the data depending on what they are meant for.

## Our first hello world API

The easiest way to understand GraphQL is to build something with it and learn as we go.

We will use something called `GQL` or **G**raphQL **Q**uery **L**anguage. We define our first simple schema like so:

### Schema

```
type Query {
  hello: string
}
```

At this point we have defined the built in type `Query` and we are saying there is one thing we can query for, namely `hello`. Note how we after `:` is saying `string`. This is us saying what the return type is for `hello`;

This means we can pose a query like so:

```
{
  hello
}
```

We won't get an answer at this point because we haven't connected it to a resolver function that knows how to answer. 

Now, connecting a schema to a resolver is done differently depending on what library you use to build your GraphQL server.

### Resolver

Let's define a resolver like it looks like in most implementations:

```js
{
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world"
  }
}
```

### Custom type

In GraphQL you have different primitives, also called scalar types, that can serve as inputs, return types. You can also combine several primitives to form a custom type. Lets first mention what those primitives are:

- **String**, this is your typical string type, containing string characters
- **ID**, represents a unique identifier, signifies that it is not intended to be human‐readable
- **Float**, A signed double-precision floating-point value
- **Int**. A signed 32‐bit integer
- **Boolean**, has the value true or false

So far we have only the queryable property `hello` and one resolver function. You are likely to want to build something more advanced than that and combining scalars in a group we can create a custom type like so:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  married: Boolean
}
```

NOTE, we starting using exclamation character `!` on the `id` field, which means that this value cannot be *null*, i.e we can't leave it out.

We can also, as mentioned use our custom type in our schema so we can extend it to look like so:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Query {
  hello: string,
  person: Person
}
```

which means we now need a new resolver function, like so:

```js
{
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    person: () => ({ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true })
  }
}
```

### List type

List type means that we can define in the schema that we get an array of whatever item back, like so:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Query {
  hello: string,
  person: Person,
  people: [Person]
}
```

We add the queryable type `people` which has the return type `[Person]` which simply means a list of the type `Person`. This of course means that we need to add a resolver function for this so we extend our resolver object with yet another function `people`:

```js
{
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    person: () => ({ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }),
    people: () => [{ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }, 
    { id: 2, name: 'Chris', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }]
  }
}
```

## Query with argument

Now you of course if going to want to filter down your response at some point by being able to ask for a specific item. Imagine you don't want the full list of people back but a specific person. For that use case we can expose a queryable that takes a parameter like so:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Query {
  hello: string,
  person: Person,
  people: [Person],
  getPerson(id: ID!): Person
}
```

Now, to add this to our resolver object we just need to add a matching name property `getPerson` but we also need to dig out the parameter from the incoming request object:

```js
const people = [{ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }, 
{ id: 2, name: 'Chris', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }];

{
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    person: () => ({ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }),
    people: () => people
    getPerson: (_, { id }) => people.find(p => p.id === id)
  }
}
```

## Mutation

So far we have concentrated on learning scalars, custom types and how to build out our resolver object to be able to answer all of our queries and that really is the *bread and butter* of mastering GraphQL. But there is another construct we need to know about to be able to build a CRUD, **C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate **D**elete API, namely *mutations*. A *Mutation* is something that in GraphQL signals that we want to change something, either create something new, update it or remove it. 

Let's start with a very simple Mutation, adding an item to a list:

```
type Mutation {
  addItem(item: String): String
}
```

Just like anything inside of a `Query` we can invoke anything inside it like a public API so we can call `addItem` like so:

```
addItem(item: "my new item")
```

Most of the time you might want a more complex input type than a scalar. At that we need to build such an input type, like so:

```
input ProductInput {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}
```

As you can see it's pretty much identicial to our `type Person` and NO we can't use that one, we need to define something of type `input` like above. Let's add a `addPerson` property to our Schema:

```
input ProductInput {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean
}

type Mutation {
  addPerson(person: PersonInput): Person
}

type Query {
  hello: string,
  person: Person,
  people: [Person],
  getPerson(id: ID!): Person
}
```

To invoke this mutation `addPerson` we type:

```
addPerson(person: { id: 3, name: 'Amy', address: `One Microsoft Way Redmond USA`, speaker: true }) {
  name
}
```

NOTE, we do get a return type of type `Person` so we need to select one or more columns as we are inserting a person but querying the response.

lastly let's add our resolve function to our object:

```js
let people = [{ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }, 
{ id: 2, name: 'Chris', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }];

{
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    person: () => ({ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }),
    people: () => people
    getPerson: (_, { id }) => people.find(p => p.id === id)
  },
  Mutation: {
    addPerson: (_ { person }) => people = [...people, {...person}]
  }
}
```

## Nested type

Quite often we want to do queries where we query at depth and we might have a schema looking like this:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String,
  address: String,
  speaker: Boolean,
  friend: Person
}
```

Especially note the property `friend`. There are two question we need an answer to here:

1. how do you store the data?
2. how do we resolve `friend`

Two very good questions and the answer is simple. 
As for how we store the data the answer is that our `friend` property needs to point to a primitive that represents the unique identifier, which means the data needs to look like this:

```js
{ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true, friend: 2 }
```

NOTE how `friend` has value `1`. 

Now to the next question, how to resolve this? What we mean by resolve is how to we support queries like this:

```
{
  person {
    id,
    name,
    address,
    friend {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

As we said this is pretty simple once you know how. Let's go to our resolver object and update it like so:

```js
let people = [{ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true, friend: 2 }, 
{ id: 2, name: 'Chris', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true, friend: 1 }];

{
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    person: () => ({ id: 1, name: 'Jen', address: 'One Microsoft Way Redmond USA', speaker: true }),
    people: () => people
    getPerson: (_, { id }) => people.find(p => p.id === id)
  },
  Mutation: {
    addPerson: (_ { person }) => people = [...people, {...person}]
  },
  Person: {
    friend: ({ friend }) => people.find(p => p.id === friend)
  }
}
```

NOTE, the addition of `Person` and its inner property `friend` that points to a resolver function that gets passed the value `2` which it is able to resolve by filtering that out of the list `people`.


## What we will build

We will build a GraphQL consisting of two different resources `Products` and `Reviews`. The idea is two:

1. Demonstrate how to build a GraphQL API
2. Learn how to build your API to support nested queries

### Part I - Install and set up

We assume you have installed Node.js already. If you haven't go to the [install page](https://nodejs.org/en/)

**Create a directory**
Next step is to create a directory and place yourself in it:

```
mkdir api
cd api
```

Thereafter we need to create a Node.js project. The easiest way is by running this command:

**Initialize a Node.js project**
```
npm init -y
```

This will run a shorter version of `npm init` and will select some nice defaults.

**Install dependencies**
Now you are ready for the next step which is to install GraphQL. We will do that by the following command:

```
npm install --save apollo-server graphql
```

**Create our Server**
We will start by creating a file `app.js` and fill it with the following content:

```js
// app.js

const { gql } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world"
  }
};

const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

Above we are defining a schedule using the `gql`, **G**raphQL **Q**uery **L**anguage. We assign our schema to the variable `typeDefs`. Then we define resolvers, functions that namewise matches what we have in our `Query`.

Next up, we want to run this server. We do so by either in the terminal run:

```
node app.js
```

We can also add the following to our `package.json` file and its `scripts` section:

```json
"start": "node app.js"
```

Then we can instead type:

```
npm start
```

This should start a server on `http://localhost:4000`

![](workshop-apollo-web.png)

Enter the following query on the left. Press the `Play` button as indicated and see the result on the right.

This concludes part 1. In the next part we will learn about creating custom types and add more resolver functions.

Here is a link to the full [source code](TODO)

### Part II - custom types

In this next part we will take our existing app and give it some more types, namely `products`. We will show how to:

- **query** for all products
- **query** for a specific product
- **create** a new product

Lets begin. 

**Refactoring**

The first thing we will do is to separate our `app.js` into several files:

- **app.js** this will only instantiate our server
- **schema.js**, this will contain our schema definition
- **resolvers.js** this will contain our resolver object

The content of these files should now be:

```js
// resolvers.js

module.exports = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world"
  }
};
```

```js
// schema.js

const { gql } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`

module.exports = typeDefs;
```

```js
// app.js

const schema = require('./schema');
const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs: schema, resolvers });

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

**Adding a custom type and some new queries**

Ok, now that we added a custom type, lets open up `schema.js` and add the custom type `Product`:

```js
// schema.js

const { gql } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Product {
    id: ID,
    name: String
  }

  type Query {
    hello: String,
    products: [Product],
    product(id: ID!): Product
  }
`

module.exports = typeDefs;
```

Above we have added the custom type `Product`, by doing this:

```
type Product {
  id: ID,
  name: String
}
```

Then we have added the following to type `Query`:

```
products: [Product],
product(id: ID!): Product
```

The first row means we can query for `products` and expect to get a product array back, as indicated by the array `[]` symbol.

The second `product(id: ID!)`, means we added a query that made it possible to query for `product` but it needs a parameter `id`. 

Below is how you would invoke them: 

```
{
  products {
    name
  }
  product(id: 1)
}
```

**Adding resolvers**

We need to add resolver methods to be able to respond if the user types either `products` or `product`. For this we will open up `resolvers.js` and ensure it looks like this:

```js
// resolvers.js

let products = [{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Avengers - End game'
}]

function getProducts() {
  return Promise.resolve(products);
}

function getProduct(id) {
  return Promise.resolve(products.find(p => p.id == id));
}

module.exports = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    products: async() => getProducts(),
    product: async(_, { id }) => getProduct(id)
  }
};
```

Above we add the methods `getProducts()` and `getProduct()` respectively. Next we add the entries to the `Query` property. We add the `async` keyword to each invocation because we are returning Promises from each method. Internally Apollo resolves this. This is only needed if your resolver methods are asynchronous. However because you are meant to get your data from somewhere, like a database, your methods are likely to be static.

NOTE, to get input parameters we need to dig those out like this `async(_, { id })`, so the second argument contains an object where one of the properties `id` is the one the user entered which we use to filter our response.

**Supporting 'create product' - adding mutations**

Now we know how to support queries, lets look into supporting scenarios in which we add data. We will support creating a product. They way we do that is by adding a mutation. Lets start with the schema file:

```js
// schema.js

const { gql } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Product {
    id: ID,
    name: String
  } 

  input ProductInput {
    name: String
  }

  type Mutation {
    createProduct(product: ProductInput): Product
  }

  type Query {
    hello: String,
    products: [Product],
    product(id: ID!): Product
  }
`

module.exports = typeDefs;
```

Above we added the type `Mutation` and in there we have added the `createProduct`, that takes a parameter `product` of type `ProductInput`. We can also see that we need to return something of type `Product`. `ProductInput` is of type `input` and is something we only use with mutations.  Ok, we got the contract explained to us, let's go to the `resolvers.js` file and support this:

```js
// resolvers.js

let products = [{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Avengers - End game'
}]

function getProducts() {
  return Promise.resolve(products);
}

function getProduct(id) {
  return Promise.resolve(products.find(p => p.id == id));
}

function createProduct(product) {
  const newProduct = { ...product, id: products.length + 1};
  products = [...products, newProduct];

  return Promise.resolve(newProduct);
}

module.exports = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    products: async() => getProducts(),
    product: async(_, { id }) => getProduct(id)
  },
  Mutation: {
    createProduct: async(_, { product }) => createProduct(product)
  }
};
```

Above we have added the method `createProduct()`. We have also added the `Mutation` property of our object that we end up exporting. Let's try this out:



### Part II - Adding reviews, supporting nested queries

Now we will extend our schema with the custom type `Review` and also support nested queries. 

To accomplish this we need too doo the following:

1. Add a custom type definition to `Review` to `schema.js`
2. Add in memory data for reviews in `resolvers.js`
3. Add resolver function to `resolvers.js`
4. Try it out 

**Add custom type definition**

The definition of `Review` should look like this:

```
type Review {
  grade: Int,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  product: Product
}
```

our `schema.js` should now look like this:

```js
const { gql } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Product {
    id: ID,
    name: String
  } 

  type Review {
    grade: Int,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    product: Product
  }

  input ProductInput {
    name: String
  }

  type Mutation {
    createProduct(product: ProductInput): Product
  }

  type Query {
    hello: String,
    products: [Product],
    product(id: ID!): Product,
    reviews: [Review]
  }
`

module.exports = typeDefs;
```

**Add in memory data**

You need to add the following code to `resolvers.js`:

```js
let reviews = [{
  grade: 5,
  title: 'Great movie',
  description: 'Great actor playing Thanos',
  product: 1
}]
```

It's also nice to add a method that we can call in our resolver, like so:

```js
function getReviews() {
  return Promise.resolve(reviews);
}
```

`resolvers.js` should look like this, at this point:

```js
let products = [{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Avengers - End game'
}]

let reviews = [{
  grade: 5,
  title: 'Great movie',
  description: 'Great actor playing Thanos',
  product: 1
}]

function getReviews() {
  return Promise.resolve(reviews);
}

function getProducts() {
  return Promise.resolve(products);
}

function getProduct(id) {
  return Promise.resolve(products.find(p => p.id == id));
}

function createProduct(product) {
  const newProduct = { ...product, id: products.length + 1};
  products = [...products, newProduct];

  return Promise.resolve(newProduct);
}

module.exports = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    products: async() => getProducts(),
    product: async(_, { id }) => getProduct(id)
  },
  Mutation: {
    createProduct: async(_, { product }) => createProduct(product)
  }
};
```

**Add resolver function**

There are two resolver function we need to add:

1. A resolver for `reviews`, this resolver will resolve if someone queries for `reviews`, like so `{ review { title, grade } }`
2. A resolver for `reviews { product { name } }`. so if someone queries for `product` under a review we need to resolve that number into a product

Adding the resolver for `reviews` is as simple as adding the following under `Query`:

```js
reviews: async() => getReviews()
```

To add the second resolver, the one that resolves `review->product`, adding the following:

```js
Review: {
  product: async(review) => getProduct(review.product)
}
```

Now this one, should be on the same level as `Query`, so the complete code should now look like this:

```js
// resolvers.js

let products = [{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Avengers - End game'
}]

let reviews = [{
  grade: 5,
  title: 'Great movie',
  description: 'Great actor playing Thanos',
  product: 1
}]

function getReviews() {
  return Promise.resolve(reviews);
}

function getProducts() {
  return Promise.resolve(products);
}

function getProduct(id) {
  return Promise.resolve(products.find(p => p.id == id));
}

function createProduct(product) {
  const newProduct = { ...product, id: products.length + 1};
  products = [...products, newProduct];

  return Promise.resolve(newProduct);
}

module.exports = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    products: async() => getProducts(),
    product: async(_, { id }) => getProduct(id),
    reviews: async() => getReviews()
  },
  Review: {
    product: async(review) => getProduct(review.product)
  },
  Mutation: {
    createProduct: async(_, { product }) => createProduct(product)
  }
};
```
