# ðŸš€ Deploy your app



## What we will build

There are two things we need to deploy:

1. **Our microservices**, to deploy those we need to upload them to a container registry. Once they are in the container registry then we can create service endpoints
2. **Our serverless API**, this is as simple to do as using VS Code and upload it by a mere click. 

### Microservices prerequisites

To do this part we need the Azure CLI installed:

```
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&
```

As we mentioned above there are two steps we need to take for each service:

- **Upload** to container registry
- **Create** a service endpoint

**Create resource group**
Let's create a Resource Group first:

```
az group create --name [name of resource group] --location westeurope
```

**Create container registry**

After that we need to create a *container registry*

```
az acr create --resource-group [name of resource group] --name [name of container registry, unique and only a-z or 0-9] --sku Basic --admin-enabled true
```

### Build, tag, push container + create endpoint

We need to do these steps for product service and reviews service.

**Build image**

Let's first build our service:

```
docker build -t products-service .
```

**Find login server value**

Next, we need to find out the `login server`. That's a two-step process

First login to our container registry:

```
az acr login --name [name of registry]
```

Now query for the login server name with:

```
az acr show --name [name of container registry] --query loginServer --output table
```

**Tag image**

Let's now use the value of *login server*

```
docker tag products-service [loginServer]/products-service:v1
```

**Push our image to the registry**

```
docker push [loginServer]/products-service:v1
```

Verify the push did its job with the following command:

```
az acr repository list --name [name of registry] --output table
```

**Create a service endpoint**

There are two ways of doing this, either:

1. Azure CLI
2. Visually through the portal

**Alt I - Azure CLI  - create endpoint**

Before we can create our endpoint we need the values for username and password, like so:

```
az acr credential show --name --query "passwords[0].value"
```

Now let's create a container in the Cloud from our pushed image:

```
az container create --resource-group [resource group] --name aci-tutorial-app --image <acrLoginServer>/[products-service or reviews-service]] --cpu 1 --memory 1 --registry-login-server [acrLoginServer] --registry-username [acrName] --registry-password [acrPassword] --dns-name-label [aciDnsLabel] --ports 80
```

**ALT II - Visually create endpoint**

To do this visually, we need to open up the portal and select to create a resource, like so:

Next select the correct template by typing `Web App for Containers`:

Thereafter fill in some mandatory fields:

Click the `Configure Container` section and select the correct container registry and the correct container (that you just created and uploaded).

That's it, that should create the endpoint..

###Â Serverless API

So how do we deploy the Serverless API?

We need to revisit our Serverless app before we can deploy, why is that? 

Right now the external endpoints in it are pointing to local IP addresses.

Looking at the file `resolvers.js` we see this:

```js
async function getReviews() {
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:8001');
  const json = await res.json();
  return json;
}

async function getProducts() {
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:8000');
  const json = await res.json();
  return json;
}
```

Both these should point to our new endpoints in Azure. To make that possible we change the above to:

```js
async function getReviews() {
  const res = await fetch(process.env.REVIEWS_URL);
  const json = await res.json();
  return json;
}

async function getProducts() {
  const res = await fetch(process.env.PRODUCTS_URL);
  const json = await res.json();
  return json;
}
```

Now, when our function app is deployed to the Cloud it will read from it's AppSettings and populate `process.env`.

> How do we get the above values to AppSettings?

There are two ways

1. **Manually add an entry** in the AppSettings in the portal for the Azure Function App once we deployed it
2. **Store these values in the file `local.settings.json`** and as part of deploying our Azure App we select to copy values from this file to AppSettings

We will show the latter

**Store app keys in local.settings.json**

Looking at the contents of `local.settings.json` it should look something like this:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node"
  }
}
```

In the `Values` property add the needed keys:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "PRODUCTS_URL": "<url to endpoint>",
    "REVIEWS_URL":"<url to endpoint>"
  }
}
```

**Deploy the Azure Function App**

Click the Azure logo on the left toolbar in VS Code.

Sign in to Azure if you haven't already done so.

![](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0485qfd86jawp4c9blx3.png)

Click the deploy symbol

![](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/p07g5173lrpvuwuusvi0.png)

Select to `Create a new Function App`

![](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/feovtte58st3x1l1byez.png)

It should start showing something like this:

![](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sx350ke8d6u820s8kycn.png)

When it's done it should say something like this:

![](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/7nis5z0xk4fcyv2y6dnm.png)

**Transfer app keys**

Now that you have an Azure Function App, right click it and select `Upload Local Settings`.

Everything should be in the Cloud now and working !
