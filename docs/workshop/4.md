# ☁️ Serverless Functions

Serverless is about writing functions in the Cloud that are fully managed. Fully managed means all we focus on is code. There's no OS, app server or anything else we need to care about, just code. This is called FaaS, functions as a service.

There are two important concepts we need to know about to learn about Azure Functions:

- **Trigger**, this is what starts the function, there are many things that can start a function like a HTTP request, a Queue message, a new database entry and so on
- **Bindings**, bindings come in two different flavors input bindings and output bindings. The idea is to set up a connection to a data source with you not having to type any code to do so. Instead a JSON file is used to point things like connection string and exactly what data you want. 
  - **Input binding**, an *input* binding means that we are reading data from a data source
  - **Output binding**, this means we are writing data to a data source

## Prerequisites

To start working with Azure Functions we need the following

- **azure functions core tools**, this is the core library
- **vs code extension** (optional), this will however make authoring and deploying a whole lot easiser

### Azure Functions Core Tools

Installing this looks a bit different on Linux, Mac and Windows.

**Mac**

```
brew tap azure/functions 
brew install azure-functions-core-tools
```

**Windows**

```
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools --unsafe-perm true
```

**Ubuntu**

```
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/19.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
```

### VS Code Extension

Install by going to this [link](vscode:extension/ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions
) or open up VS Code and type `Azure Functions`

## What we will build

We will do the following:

- **Create** an Azure Function
- **Integrate** our GraphQL API
- **Add** external endpoints to our GraphQL API

### Create an Azure Function

We will use the fact that we have installed the Azure Function VS Code extension. It comes with some valuable commands that will help us scaffold the function we need.

**Scaffold an Azure Function App + Function**

An Azure Function needs to be hosted in an Azure Function App. To create an open up the Command Palette in VS Code (CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + P) or View/Command Palette. Thereafter type `Azure Functions: Create New Project` and select that.

**First**, you will be prompted to what folder contains your project. The normal choice is the folder you are standing in.

**Secondly**, you are asked for what programming language you want the project to be, select `JavaScript`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1%2Ao0DqKyhGpjPYG6Owd_hAQQ.png)

**Thirdly**, you are asked for what template to use for your first function in your Azure Functions project. Select `HttpTrigger`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1%2AtOj9evR2VzUHN3769auafg.png)

**Fourth**, now it's asking what to name our function, we name it `GraphQL`, but you can name whatever you want

**Fifth**, lastly it's asking you for authhorization level, essentially what credentials you need to pass to be able to call it. Select *anonymous*

Now, we should have project overview looking something like this:

```
.vscode/
GraphQL/ -- this is our function
  function.json -- this a bindings config file
  index.js -- this is our Azure Function
.funcignore
host.json
local.settings.json -- this contains app settings keys
package.json -- contains Node.js project settings
proxies.json
```

### Quick look at our Azure Function

TODO

### Integrate GraphQL

So how do we go about integrating GraphQL?

We need to do the following:
- **Move** in the GraphQL files into our Azure project
- **Remove** the part where Apollo hosts the web server
- **Update Azure Function** with call to GraphQL
- **Add** the needed libraries to package.json

**Move files**

We simply move in our files into this structure, like so.

```
.vscode/
GraphQL/ -
  function.json 
  API/
    app.js
    resolvers.js
    schema.js
.funcignore
host.json
local.settings.json 
package.json 
proxies.json
```

Let's highlight our addition:

```
API/
  app.js
  resolvers.js
  schema.js
```

**Remove Apollo Web Server**

Open up the `app.js` file under the `API` directory. It should look like this currently: 

```js
// API/app.js

const schema = require('./schema');
const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs: schema, resolvers });

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

Remove the last line and replace it with an exports command, so it now looks like this:

```js
// API/app.js

const schema = require('./schema');
const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs: schema, resolvers });

module.exports = server;
```

**Update Azure Function**

Let's have a look at our Azure function:

```js
// index.js

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
  context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

  if (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name)) {
      context.res = {
          // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
          body: "Hello " + (req.query.name || req.body.name)
      };
  }
  else {
      context.res = {
          status: 400,
          body: "Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body"
      };
  }
};
```

Let's update it to start using GraphQL. What we want to achieve is the following:

- **read** query parameter `query`
- **use** value of `query` to query our GraphQL server
- **respond** with data from GraphQL Server

Given the above agenda, let's change `index.js` to the following:

```js
const server = require('./API/app');

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    if (req.query.query || (req.body && req.body.query)) {
        const query = (req.query.query || req.body.query);
        try {
            const result = await server.executeOperation({
                query
            });

            context.res = {
                // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
                contentType: 'application/json',
                body: result
            };
        } catch(err) {
           context.res = {
               status: 500,
               body: "We messed up"
           };
        }
        
    } else {
        context.res = {
            status: 400,
            body: "Please pass a `query` on the query string or in the request body"
        };
    }
};
```

**Update package.json**

We need to update our `package.json` file so it contains the needed libraries for GraphQL to function, so ensure `dependencies` contains the following:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "apollo-server": "^2.7.0-alpha.3",
  "graphql": "^14.4.1",
  "node-fetch": ""
}
```

### Add external endpoints

We need to realize the following. We have built two microservices that we can now use, so we no longer need to use the in-memory data. So let's do the following

```
npm install node-fetch --save
```

Now let's open `resolvers.js` and change it to the following:

```js
// resolvers.js

const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function getReviews() {
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:8001');
  const json = await res.json();
  return json;
}

async function getProducts() {
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:8000');
  const json = await res.json();
  return json;
}

async function getProduct(id) {
  const products = await getProducts();
  return Promise.resolve(products.find(p => p.id == id));
}

function createProduct(product) {
  const newProduct = {
    ...product,
    id: products.length + 1
  };
  products = [...products, newProduct];

  return Promise.resolve(newProduct);
}

module.exports = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => "world",
    products: async () => getProducts(),
    product: async (_, {
      id
    }) => getProduct(id),
    reviews: async () => getReviews()
  },
  Review: {
    product: async (review) => getProduct(review.product)
  },
  Mutation: {
    createProduct: async (_, {
      product
    }) => createProduct(product)
  }
};
```

Not how we changed the methods `getProducts()` and `getReviews()` to know use our HTTP endpoints instead.

Try and debug the function and type the following URL in the browser window:

```
http://localhost:8080?query={ reviews { title, grade, product { name }} }
```

Above we are posing the query:

```
{ 
  reviews { 
    title, 
    grade, 
    product { 
      name 
    }
  } 
}
```

This nested query should now resolve by querying both our products endpoint and our reviews endpoint.
